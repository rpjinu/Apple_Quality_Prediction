🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of apples based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing apple features and their corresponding quality labels (good or bad). Once trained, the model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, where users can input feature values and get real-time predictions.

🌟 Features
Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest classifier is used to predict apple quality.

Interactive Web Interface: Built using Streamlit, the app allows users to input apple features and view predictions.

Scalable: The model can be easily retrained with new data for better accuracy.

User-Friendly: Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.

Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.

Git/GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Feature	Description
Size	Size of the apple (numeric value).
Weight	Weight of the apple (numeric value).
Sweetness	Sweetness level of the apple.
Crunchiness	Crunchiness level of the apple.
Juiciness	Juiciness level of the apple.
Ripeness	Ripeness level of the apple.
Acidity	Acidity level of the apple.
Quality	Target variable: good or bad.
🛠 Steps to Build the Project
1. Data Preparation
Load the dataset using Pandas.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships.

Map the target variable (Quality) to numerical values: good → 1, bad → 0.

2. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a Random Forest classifier using Scikit-learn.

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

3. Save the Model
Save the trained model and preprocessing objects (e.g., scaler, mapping dictionary) using Joblib.

4. Build the Streamlit App
Create an interactive web interface using Streamlit.

Allow users to input apple features and display the predicted quality.

5. Test the App
Run the Streamlit app locally and test it with various inputs.

6. Deploy the App
Deploy the app using platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS.
